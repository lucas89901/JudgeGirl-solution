Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done
more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed
the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the
house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the
chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted
into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was. The housekeeper came a respectable-looking
elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding
her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room,
handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy
its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving
increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.
